As an *Enhances* dependency to the CRAN R package [ricu](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ricu), this data package provides the [eICU demo data set](https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd-demo/2.0/). Due to CRAN size restrictions, this cannot be served from CRAN but rather can be installed from a [GitHub-hosted drat repository](https://github.com/eth-mds/physionet-demo).

## Installation

The released version of [eicu.demo](https://github.com/eth-mds/eicu-demo) can be installed as:

``` r
install.packages(
  "eicu.demo",
  repos = "https://eth-mds.github.io/physionet-demo"
)
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) is available as:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eth-mds/eicu-demo")
```
